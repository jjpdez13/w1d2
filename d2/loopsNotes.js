// Loops Lecture

/* GUIDED PRACTICE */

/* 1. Write a loop that logs the numbers 1-10. */



/* 2. Write a loop that iterates through a string, and logs each character. */



/* 3. Write a while loop that performs a certain task, and then write a for loop
that accomplishes the same task. */



/* 4. Create and invoke a function that logs every number from 0 to a given
number. */



/* 5. Create and invoke a function that iterates through a string and prints
every character. */



/* 6. Rewrite the last two functions to iterate backwards instead of forwards. */



/* 7. Rewrite the two functions to print EVERY OTHER number or character,
instead of EVERY number or character. */
