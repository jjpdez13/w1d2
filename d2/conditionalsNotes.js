// Conditionals Notes

/* GUIDED PRACTICE */

/* 1. Write a conditional statement for a mutually exclusive condition. */



/* 2. Write a conditional statement for a non-mutually exclusive condition. */



/* 3. Write a function that returns a boolean based on conditional logic.*/



/* BONUS: Use ternary statement syntax or shorthand to write a
conditional statement, and write the same statement with if/else syntax. */
